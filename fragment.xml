      <p>This course will walk you through a patterns-based approach to building real-world cloud solutions. The patterns apply to the development process as well as to architecture and coding practices.</p>

<p>The concepts are illustrated with concrete examples, and each module includes links to other resources that provide more in-depth information. The examples and the links to additional resources are for Microsoft frameworks and services, but the principles illustrated apply to other web development frameworks and cloud environments as well.</p>

<p>This is part three of a three-course series. New patterns introduced in part 3 include monitoring, telemetry, and designing apps to survive failure.</p>

<p>SO... WHAT DO YOU WANT TO LEARN?</p>

<p>Do you have any burning questions about developing apps for the cloud? Once you enroll, please send your question to DEV202x@microsoft.com. Not only will this help us fine-tune the course content but Tom Dykstra and Rick Anderson will post answer to the most asked questions when the course launches.</p>
