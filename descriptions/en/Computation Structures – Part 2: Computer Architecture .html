      Digital systems are at the heart of the information age in which we live, allowing us to store, communicate and manipulate information quickly and reliably. This computer science course is a bottom-up exploration of the abstractions, principles, and techniques used in the design of digital and computer systems. If you have a rudimentary knowledge of electricity and some exposure to programming, roll up your sleeves, join in and design a computer system!

Using your browser for design entry and simulation, you’ll implement a 32-bit computer using our gate library and write assembly language programs to explore the hardware/software interface.

This is Part 2 of a 3-part program on digital systems.

    </p><h2>You will learn</h2>The design of an instruction set for computer systems
	How to translate high-level programs into sequences of computer instructions
	The design of the datapath and control logic for a 32-bit computer
	The role of caches in the memory hierarchy
