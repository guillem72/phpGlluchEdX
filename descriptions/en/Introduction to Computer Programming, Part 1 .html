</head><body><!-- MOOC from Edx --><h1>Introduction to Computer Programming, Part 1 </h1><p>
      
      Basic concepts of computer programming are introduced starting with the notion of an algorithm. Emphasis is on developing the ability to write programs to solve practical computational problems.

Topics include: 

Algorithms
	Elements of C/C++ programming languages
	Basic data types
	Sequential and conditional execution
	Iterative solutions
	Arrays, matrices and their applications
	Functions
	Sorting and searching
	Elements of string processing
	Introduction to pointers
	Basics of Software Engineering
	Structures
	File Processing
Participants will get to read and understand many sample programs, and will have to write several on their own. This course deals with procedural programming, and attempts to inculcate good programming practices in a novice programmer.

    </p><h2>You will learn</h2>Learn to write C++ programs, compile, and execute using the gcc/simplecpp compiler
	How to inculcate good programming practices
	How to write programs and develop the ability to solve practical real world computational problems
	How to logically think and produce a solution (program)Â
