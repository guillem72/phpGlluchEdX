</head><body><!-- MOOC from Edx --><h1>Building Cloud Apps with Microsoft Azure – Part 1 </h1><p>
      
      This course will walk you through a patterns-based approach to building real-world cloud solutions. The patterns apply to the development process as well as to architecture and coding practices.
 
The concepts are illustrated with concrete examples, and each module includes links to other resources that provide more in-depth information. The examples and the links to additional resources are for Microsoft frameworks and services, but the principles illustrated apply to other web development frameworks and cloud environments as well.
 
This is part one of a three course series.
