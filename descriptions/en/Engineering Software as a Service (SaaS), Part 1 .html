      This intermediate SaaS courses uncovers how to code long-lasting software using highly-productive Agile techniques to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) using Ruby on Rails. Learners will understand the new challenges and opportunities of SaaS versus shrink-wrapped software. They will understand and apply fundamental programming techniques to the design, development, testing, and public cloud deployment of a simple SaaS application. Using best-of-breed tools that support modern development techniques including behavior-driven design, user stories, test-driven development, velocity, and pair programming, learners will see how modern programming language features like metaprogramming and reflection can improve productivity and code maintainability.

Weekly coding projects and quizzes will be part of the learning experience in this SaaS course. Those who successfully complete the assignments and earn a passing grade can get an honor code certificate or verified certificate from BerkeleyX. The videos and homework assignments used in this offering of the course were revised in October 2013. The new class also includes embedded live chat with Teaching Assistants and other students and opportunities for remote pair programming with other students.
