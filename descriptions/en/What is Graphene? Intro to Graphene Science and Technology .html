        This is an Archived Course
        EdX keeps courses open for enrollment after they end to allow learners to explore content and continue learning. All features and materials may not be all available. Check back often to see when new course start dates are announced.
      
      What is graphene? Graphene is the world’s first 2-dimensional material and is the thinnest, strongest, and most flexible material known to exist. A special form of carbon, graphene can conduct electricity and heat better than anything else.

The course will introduce you to the exciting world of graphene science and technology. You will learn about the fundamentals of graphene and how this material offers new insights into nanotechnology and quantum physics. You will also learn about emerging practical applications for graphene. Topics covered include material properties, electronics, physics, physical chemistry, synthesis and device fabrication and application.

In order to benefit fully from this course you should have an adequate knowledge of general physics and university level mathematics.

Graphene offers a wealth of potential future applications; in composites, solar cells, sensors, superchargers, etc. The list is endless.

This course takes a closer look at the particular potential graphene offers within electronics, e.g. optoelectronic devices using graphene produced via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), an industrially compatible technique.

You should expect to devote 6 hours weekly to the course. Each week features a series of lecture sequences supported by interactive video tutorials and interspersed exercises or problems. Students will work on a homework assignment or quiz each week. We offer an Honor Code Certificate.

Content was developed at Chalmers University of Technology. Chalmers is the coordinator of the Graphene Flagship, EUs biggest research initiative ever. At the Chalmers Graphene Centre research and industry cooperate in the field to achieve interplay and synergies.
