      The knowledge base of the world is rapidly expanding, and much of this information is being put online as textual data. Understanding how to parse and analyze this growing amount of data is essential for any organization that would like to extract valuable insights and gain competitive advantage. This course will demonstrate how text mining can answer business related questions, with a focus on technological innovation. 

This is a highly modular course, based on data science principles and methodologies. We will look into technological innovation through mining articles and patents and implement natural language processing. We will also utilize other available sources of competitive intelligence, such as the gray literature and knowledge bases of companies, news databases, social media feeds and search engine outputs. Text mining will be carried out using Python, and could be easily followed by running the provided iPython notebooks that execute the code.

FAQ

Who is this course for?

The course is intended for data scientists of all levels as well as domain experts on a managerial level. Data scientists will receive a variety of different toolsets, expanding knowledge and capability in the area of qualitative and semantic data analyses. Managers will receive hands-on oversight to a high-growth field filled with business promise, and will be able to spot opportunities for their own organization. You are encouraged to bring your data sources and business questions, and develop a professional portfolio of your work to share with others. The discussion forums of the course will be the place where professionals from around the world share insights and discuss data challenges.

How will the course be taught?

The first week of the course describes a range of business opportunities and solutions centered around the use of text. Subsequent weeks identify sources of competitive intelligence, in text, and provide solutions for parsing and storing incoming knowledge. Using real-world case studies, the course provides examples of the most useful statistical and machine learning techniques for handling text, semantic, and social data. We then describe how and what you can infer from the data, and discuss useful techniques for visualizing and communicating the results to decision-makers.
