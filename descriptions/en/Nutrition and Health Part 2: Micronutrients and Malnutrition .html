      Food plays a central role in our society but few people actually understand what it does to our bodies. Learn more about nutrition and how our diet  profoundly impacts our current and future health. The course will focus on undernutrition and micronutrients. The team of Professors from Wageningen University will introduce you into the chemistry of vitamins and minerals.

The course will address the micronutrient content of foods and will cover the role of the various micronutrients in the body.  In addition, NUTR102x will discuss how suboptimal nutrition may affect human health and will pay particular attention to global hunger and malnutrition.

No previous knowledge needed but course adds to knowledge from NUTR101x. Join us to learn more about nutrition and health.

NUTR102x is part of the Nutrition-Food for Health xSeries of Wageningen University.
