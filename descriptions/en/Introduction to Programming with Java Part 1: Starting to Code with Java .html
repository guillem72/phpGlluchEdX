      This is an introductory course to learn programming with Java, one of the most in-demand programming languages designed to work across multiple software platforms. Java developers are highly sought after professionals, and increasingly so, Java is a staple of every technologist’s resume!

This Java learning series is comprised of three parts, of which Part 1 introduces programming on the basis of familiar concepts, like calculators and games. Powerful concepts such as functional abstraction, the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are progressively introduced throughout the five weeks. Examples and case studies are provided so that learners can implement simple programs on their own or by collaborating with peers.

Part 2 will focus on how to write “good” programs and Part 3 will deal with fundamental data structures. Part 2 and Part 3 will be scheduled soon.

Programming knowledge is not only needed to program today’s devices such as computers and smartphones, but it also opens doors to computational thinking, i.e., the application of computing techniques to every-day processes.

With new content and enhanced problems, this is an improved version of the course released in April 2015. Previous learners are welcome to enroll for a second time, and continue learning!

Throughout this course, emphasis is placed on immediate feedback and having fun. Enroll today and start your journey in the field of computer science!

“This course is Awesome. And professor Carlos, Just WOW! His video lectures are so clear and so full of enthusiasm that I decided to upgrade to a verified track, which I'm doing for the first time in edX. I'm loving Java!” – Past student
