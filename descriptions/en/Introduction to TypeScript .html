The TypeScript language features an innovative structural type system that incorporates gradual typing and type inference. In this course, you'll learn how to use features of TypeScript such as optional static types, classes, interfaces, and modules to JavaScript, enabling IDE productivity features such as statement completion, refactoring, and code navigation.

The TypeScript project is open-source and hosted on GitHub.
