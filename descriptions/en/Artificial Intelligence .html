        This is an Archived Course
        EdX keeps courses open for enrollment after they end to allow learners to explore content and continue learning. All features and materials may not be all available. Check back often to see when new course start dates are announced.
      
      Artificial intelligence is already all around you, from web search to video games. AI methods plan your driving directions, filter your spam, and focus your cameras on faces. AI lets you guide your phone with your voice and read foreign newspapers in English. Beyond today's applications, AI is at the core of many new technologies that will shape our future. From self-driving cars to household robots, advancements in AI help transform science fiction into real systems.

The course will introduce the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. CS188.1x focuses on Behavior from Computation and will cover the following areas:

Statistical and decision–theoretic modeling paradigm. By the end of this course, you will have built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in stochastic and in adversarial settings.
	Reasoning and Learning. With this additional machinery your agents will be able to draw inferences in uncertain environments and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures. Your machine learning algorithms will classify handwritten digits and photographs.
	Applications for a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems. The techniques you learn in CS188x will serve as the foundation for further study in any application area you choose to pursue.
Join us today to learn more about how AI affects your life, and where it is headed in the future.
