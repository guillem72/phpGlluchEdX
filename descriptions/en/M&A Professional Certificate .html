Taught by instructors with decades of experience on Wall Street, this series will equip analysts and associates with the skills they need to rise in the M&A field.

 The M&A Professional Certificate is presented in five modules – Concepts and Theories: An Introduction, Concepts and Theories: Advanced Topics, Structuring the Deal, Free Cash Flow: A Powerful Decision-Making Metric, and Accounting for Mergers & Acquisitions. There is a final module consisting of the M&A Professional Certification Examination.
 
Those participants who pass the Examination will receive an accredited certificate bearing the New York Institute of Finance (NYIF) name. A NYIF certificate, highly valued in the finance industry, will bolster a resume or LinkedIn profile and prove the skills you’ve gained to potential employers. </p>
