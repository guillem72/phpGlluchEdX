      6.00.2x will teach you how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals and provides you with a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving . This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity. You will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. For example, you will write a program that will simulate a robot vacuum cleaning a room or will model the population dynamics of viruses replicating and drug treatments in a patient's body.

Topics covered include:

Plotting with the pylab package
	Random walks
	Probability, Distributions
	Monte Carlo simulations
	Curve fitting
	Knapsack problem, Graphs and graph optimization
	Machine learning basics, Clustering algorithms
	Statistical fallacies

    </p><h2>You will learn</h2>Plotting with the pylab package
	Stochastic programming and statistical thinking
	Monte Carlo simulations
