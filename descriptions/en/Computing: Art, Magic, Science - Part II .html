      Computing is a science. It’s an art, at least for those who practice it well, and it still retains much of its magic.

Part 1 of this course introduced the fundamental concepts, preparing you for the more advanced topics covered in this course!

Throughout this course, you will learn programming concepts and techniques, and practice them immediately through advanced browser-based tools that let you write programs, compile, run  and test them against predefined test sets. You will see your results right away in your browser!

In this Part 2, we will discuss:

A major programming technique, inheritance, including Multiple inheritance: combining complementary abstractions
	Selective exports for solid modular design of large systems
	Functional programming with agents: going one level of abstraction higher or more
	Concurrency: how to build applications that, so to speak, walk and chew gum at the same time
	Design patterns: how you can benefit from the best architectural practices of the industry, ironed out over many decades
	What makes a loop do its job right, with the notion of loop invariant
	Important practical examples: how to write an interactive application with undo-redo, and the example of topological sort
	Software engineering-- the construction not just of individual programs but also of complex, ambitious software systems
Join us in this computing and programming course to better understand the power and beauty of modern computer programming.
