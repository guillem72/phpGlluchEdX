      Do you want to become a better problem solver?

This Java course will provide you with a strong understanding of basic Java programming elements and data abstraction using problem representation and the object-oriented framework. As the saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” This course will use sample objects such as photos or images to illustrate some important concepts to enhance understanding and retention. You will learn to write procedural programs using variables, arrays, control statements, loops, recursion, data abstraction and objects in an integrated development environment.

This course is comprised of two 5-week parts.

Part 1 introduces programming fundamentals.

Problem solving
	Primitive data types and arithmetic expressions
	Object-oriented programming basics
	Branching and Loops
	Arrays
Part 2 covers the following topics.

String manipulation
	File I/O
	Simple event-driven programming
	Recursion
	Abstract data types

    </p><h2>You will learn</h2>Take a “real-life” problem and abstract out the pertinent aspects necessary to solve it in an algorithmic manner.
	Formulate formal solutions to well-defined problems using the logic of a programming language.
	Implement formal solutions in Java using an integrated development environment.
	Understand the basics of data abstraction using the object-oriented framework.
