      Nanoelectronic devices are an integral part of our life, including the billion-plus transistors in every smartphone, each of which has an active region that is only a few hundred atoms in length.

This nanotechnology course explains the fundamentals of nanoelectronics and mesoscopic physics.

Even with NO prior background in quantum mechanics, you should learn about cutting-edge developments and concepts that will prepare you for a future in nanotechnology and nanoelectronics.

Indeed we hope you will be excited to join the field and help invent the new devices that will shape the electronics of this century and meet its challenges.

Second in a two part series, this nanotechnology course provides an introduction to more advanced topics, including the Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function (NEGF) method widely used to analyze quantum transport in nanoscale devices. We will explore a number of topics within nanoelectronics, taking a more in depth look at quantum transport, gaining greater insight into the application of the Schrodinger Equation, and learning the basics of spintronics.

“The course was just awesome!”

- Student from Part A

This course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and the National Science Foundation with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. These courses focus on cutting-edge topics distilled into short lectures with quizzes and practice exams.
