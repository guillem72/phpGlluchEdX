      Once heralded as the ultimate vehicle for open communication and self-expression, the internet is rapidly becoming a globally networked surveillance device. Serious threats to national security, combined with the seemingly endless capacity of digital processing and storage, have led to levels of data capture and 24/7 monitoring of individuals’ activity that were unimaginable even a decade ago.
 
With resistance to such practices rising, this course will equip you to take an active part in the debate. You will gain a broad understanding of the competing tensions of the laws related to national security and personal and commercial privacy in the post-Snowden online environment, and grasp the looming consequences of this battle for peace, sovereignty, human rights and the internet itself.
 

    </p><h2>You will learn</h2>New insights into the extent, purposes and impact of global networked surveillance technologies
	Knowledge of the nature and consequences of cyber-activism and cyberwar
	Understanding of the spectrum of responses to the complexity of issues involved in online surveillance and security
