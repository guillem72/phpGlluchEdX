</head><body><!-- MOOC from Edx --><h1>Implementing Real-Time Analytics with Hadoop in Azure HDInsight </h1><p>
      
      Learn how to implement low-latency and streaming Big Data solutions using Hadoop technologies like HBase, Storm, and Spark on Microsoft Azure HDInsight. You’ll learn to create and query HBase and Apache Spark tables to address problems and find solutions using Big Data.

This course is the second in a series that explores big data and advanced analytics techniques with HDInsight; and builds on the batch processing techniques learned in DAT202.1x: Processing Big Data with Hadoop in Azure HDInsight. A third course in this series will follow this one to cover predictive analytics in HDInsight.

Note: To complete the hands-on elements in this course, you will require an Azure subscription and a Windows client computer. You can sign up for a free Azure trial subscription (a valid credit card is required for verification, but you will not be charged for Azure services). Note that the free trial is not available in all regions. However, it is possible to complete the course and earn a certificate without completing the hands-on practices.

    </p><h2>You will learn</h2>Create and query HBase tables.
